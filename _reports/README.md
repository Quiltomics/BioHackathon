# Reports
## Dayly reports
We have three reports scheduled at 14:00. One each day after the first hacking day. We are expecting each project representative to fill in one slide and not spend more than one minute per project during the report.

## Writeathon
We all aim to meet at the end of the BioHackathon for a 90 minutes sprint to write a final report in the form of a publication. We expect all participants to be authors and contribute with the writing. We plan to organise the publication in 4 themes and 11 topics relying on the outcomes of the projects. If you keep the reports informative and tidy later it will be easier to reuse them to write the publication.

The writeathon is led by Sira and Jen. They are thinking about the paper structure and content. Please talk to them if you have any suggestions. Feel free as well to comment on the brainstorming document: https://tinyurl.com/bh2018write
