# Reports
## Dayly reports
We have three reports scheduled at 14:00. One each day after the first hacking day. We are expecting each project representative to fill in one slide and present a project update in less than a minute.

## Writeathon
We all aim to meet at the end of the BioHackathon for a 90 minutes sprint to write a final report in the form of a publication. We expect all participants to be authors and contribute with the writing. The writeathon is led by Sira and Jen. They are thinking about the paper structure and content. Please talk to them if you have any suggestions. Feel also free to comment on the brainstorming document: https://tinyurl.com/bh2018write
