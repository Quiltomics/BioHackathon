# Development of a catalog of federated SPARQL queries in the field of Rare Diseases

Orphanet INSERM US14 - ELixir FR - Excelerate WP8 RD use case

## Leads

Marc Hanauer, Andra Waagmeester

## Background information
---
Orphanet is a website dedicated to rare diseases, providing several kind of information such nomenclature, classifications, textual information, disorders/genes relations and also dedicated resources in the field (Experts centres, Diagnostic tests, clinical trials, orphandrugs, registries and biobanks, supports groups etc.) for more than 40 countries. 
The site has a huge audience, around 1 million unique visitors/month and 8 languages.

The database content is linked to the Orphanet nomenclature

![Orphanet_Map](images/ORPHANET-map.png)

and we provide several dataset, also accessible on our platform Orphadata https://www.orphadata.org

![Orphadata](images/Screenshot_Orphadata.png)

Orphanet produce also the Orphanet Rare Diseases Ontology and clinical description of diseases using HPO ontology. Each disease concept has a unique, stable, identifier (Orphacode) which could be used to identify diseases in health information system. The orphacode has been integrated in several countries.

## Expected outcomes
---

Orphanet provides an ontology (ORDO) for rare diseases and also an ontological module (HOOM) to disseminate phenotypic information based on HPO. ORDO+HOOM are available with a blazegraph docker image and also a sparql endpoint.

Blazegraph docker with ORDO and HOOM

We will try to leverage the knowledge of RD by the uses of accessible sparql endpoint (EBI, wikidata, wikipathway, bio2rdf etc.) and provides a catalogue of relevant federated sparql queries

## Expected audience
---

programmes, ontologists : python, java, RDF/OWL, Sparql
**Expected hacking days**: 3 days

## Approaches to reach goals
1) Identify relevant resource in the RD field, available through SPARQL Endpoint
Starting point: EBI, Uniprot, Wikidata, Bioportal, Bio2RDF, neXtProt...

wikipathways

2) Setup user friendly web interface to :

a) manage/comment datasource

b) provide sample queries for each datasource

c) edit and manage queries

3) Modelise several SPARQL Federated Queries

Tasks can be done in parallel

## Hack Day 1 progress
---

- Setup a wikibase which will contain sources description, "queries" in natural languages and federated queries examples
(wikibase is an extension of mediawiki)
```
https://www.mediawiki.org/wiki/Wikibase/Installation#Download_from_Git
```

- Based on "natural languages queries" (a use case), start to explore Orphanet Ontology and Disgenet 
```
- For a given disease in Orphanet find all known related genes in Orphanet itself 
- For a given disease in Orphanet find all known related genes in DisGeNET 
Compare the output of the two queries. 
```

- Parallel task: play with the ORDO/HPO association model (dealing with collection)
