Data sources

UniProt
This section needs to be filled in.

DrugBANK

https://www.drugbank.ca/releases/latest
You need a user account to download.  They do have an API:
https://docs.drugbankplus.com/v1/
This is an XML file.

But again need a token to get access and you may have to pay: 
https://www.drugbankplus.com/api.html

ChEMBL

https://www.ebi.ac.uk/chembl/api/data/molecule.json
Returns a paginated list of all the molecules in ChEMBL, note we only want "molecule_type": "Small molecule".

Using ChEMBL's own python script we create a file containing the molecules to targets.







Reactome

Need to make 2 separate calls to get all the information we require.  These calls are based upon the UniProt accession.
1. This first call returns the set of pathways that a protein entry is involved in:
https://reactome.org/ContentService/interactors/static/molecule/P21802/pathways?species=Homo%20sapiens&onlyDiagrammed=false
2. This second and more important call defines all the interactors that a protein entry has:
https://reactome.org/ContentService/interactors/static/molecule/P21802/details?page=-1&pageSize=-1

Both return JSON

IntAct
Download: ftp://ftp.ebi.ac.uk/pub/databases/intact/current/psimitab/intact.zip
Tab separated file. We only need a few of the fields: 1, 2, 10, 11, 12 and 15
eg:
#ID(s) interactor A     ID(s) interactor B    Taxid interactor A      Taxid interactor B      Interaction type(s)    Confidence score

Human Phenotype Ontology

Need two files.
1. http://compbio.charite.de/jenkins/job/hpo.annotations/lastStableBuild/artifact/misc/phenotype_annotation.tab
Provides the set of links between OMIM and Decipher to HPO terms.
This is a text tab delimited file.

2. http://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/hp.obo
Provides the full HPO entry
This is a specific text file format developed for ontologies.
