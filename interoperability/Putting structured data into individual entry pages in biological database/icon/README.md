If we want to distinguish the Operating System of Software, ICON is reasonable to show.

* Linux icon (=Tux penguin) http://isc.tamu.edu/~lewing/linux/
* Windows (=window figure) https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/legal/intellectualproperty/trademarks/usage/publications.aspx
* Mac OS (=apple figure) https://www.apple.com/jp/legal/intellectual-property/guidelinesfor3rdparties.html (JAPANESE)

We could not use logo image of Mac OS without the reference comment. 
=> We prepared "apple image" by ourselves.
   The license of these two apple images are under Public domain (CC-0)
